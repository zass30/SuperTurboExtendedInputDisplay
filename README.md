# SuperTurboExtendedInputDisplay
Extended input display for Super Street Fighter 2: Turbo, inspired by Virtua Fighter training mode

## Getting Started
This will get you running training mode with full extended display.

### Prerequisites
 * POF's training mode: http://pof.eslack.org/2014/04/22/ssf2t-the-quest-for-the-perfect-training-mode/
 * roms for super turbo: ssf2.zip, ssf2t.zip, and ssf2xj.zip roms. You need to get these on your own.
 
### Installing
 * Download the sf2-hitboxes_and_VF_input.lua file, and make sure it's in the same directory as your training mode batch file. 
 * Download the scrolling-input directory, and make sure it's in the same directory as sf2-hitboxes_and_VF_input.lua. 
 * Start the game and move the joystick. You should see inputs scrolling on the side of the display.

## Troubleshooting
 * **I get an error saying "unexpected symbol near <"** : Make sure you download the lua file as raw.
